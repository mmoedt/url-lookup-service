- Set up docker container, install all needed dependencies there
  - e.g. for debian, python3 python3.11-venv

- Set up GitHub project:
   - CI pipeline in GitHub, to run the automated tests
     and prevent merging of feature branches that don't pass tests
   - Prevent pushing directly to the 'main' branch
   - Require code reviews of feature branches as well before merging

- Add deployment command, perhaps triggered via CI pipelines
  - only on main branch, or perhaps release branches that branch from main

- Update 'build' perhaps 'pre-push' script commands
  - run a linter
  - run a 'prettier' style command to standardize the format of the source
    (this really helps with code reviews, so that only actual changes are shown, not style arguments)
